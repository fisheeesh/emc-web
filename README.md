## üëã Introduction

The **Emotion Check-in System** is a comprehensive platform that helps organizations support employee well-being while tracking attendance. Employees use a mobile app to check in daily and share how they feel through simple emoji choices and optional notes. HR and Super Admins can then use a powerful web dashboard to view overall trends in employee emotions and attendance, displayed in easy-to-understand charts and AI-powered insights.

By combining daily attendance with emotional insights, the system enables organizations to notice patterns, provide timely support when negative moods persist, and create a healthier, more productive work environment.

The system includes:
- **React + Vite frontend** for intuitive dashboards, analytics, and management
- **TypeScript/Express backend** with Prisma, Redis, and BullMQ for emotion processing, AI analysis, and background jobs
- **AI-powered insights** using Groq API for sentiment analysis and recommendations
- **Rich communication** with MDX Editor for announcements and action plans

For detailed documentation, see:

- [Backend README](./backend/README.md)
