## Overview

The Emotion Check-in System is a platform that helps organizations support employee well-being while also keeping track of attendance. Employees use a mobile app to check in each day and share how they feel through simple emoji choices and short notes. After submitting, they receive confirmation that both their attendance and emotion have been recorded.

HR and Super Admin can then use a web dashboard to view overall trends in employee emotions and attendance, displayed in easy-to-understand charts and reports. By combining daily attendance with emotional insights, the system enables organizations to notice patterns, provide timely support when negative moods persist, and create a healthier, more productive work environment.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory (production values should be set in your hosting environment):

```env
NODE_ENV="development"
PORT="8080"
APP_DEBUG="true"

# JWT Secrets (generate your own secure keys)
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="your-access-token-secret-here"
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET="your-refresh-token-secret-here"

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloudinary-cloud-name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-cloudinary-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-cloudinary-api-secret"

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL="your-redis-connection-url"
REDIS_HOST="your-redis-host"
REDIS_PORT="your-redis-port"
REDIS_PASSWORD="your-redis-password"

# AI Configuration
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="your-postgresql-connection-string"

# Email Configuration (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-api-key"
SENDER_EMAIL="no-reply@yourdomain.com"
RECIEVER_EMAIL="your-admin-email@yourdomain.com"

# Frontend URL (for CORS and email links)
DASHBOARD_URL="your-deployed-frontend-url"
```

### CORS Configuration

The application uses a strict whitelist for CORS. Update the whitelist in your code to include your deployed frontend URLs:

```javascript
var whitelist = [
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'http://127.0.0.1:5173',
    'http://localhost:4000',
    'http://127.0.0.1:4000',
    'https://your-deployed-frontend-url.vercel.app',
    'https://yourdomain.com'
]
```

### Cookie Configuration

The system uses different cookie configurations for development and production:
- **Development**: Cookies work on HTTP for local testing
- **Production**: Enforces Secure flag for HTTPS-only transmission
