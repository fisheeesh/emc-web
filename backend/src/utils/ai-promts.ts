INPUT: "${moodMessage}"

FORMAT STRUCTURE:
The input follows: [EMOJI]([EMOTION_LABEL]) // [USER_DESCRIPTION]
- EMOJI: Visual representation of mood
- EMOTION_LABEL: The user's self-identified emotion (THIS IS PRIMARY)
- USER_DESCRIPTION: Context and intensity of the feeling

CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: The EMOTION_LABEL in parentheses is the ground truth. It always takes precedence over emoji interpretation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY PRIMARY EMOTION:
Extract the EMOTION_LABEL from parentheses. This determines the base sentiment category (positive/neutral/negative/critical).

STEP 2 - DETERMINE BASE SCORE:
Match the emotion label to the appropriate range using the keywords above.

STEP 3 - ASSESS INTENSITY MODIFIERS:
Scan the USER_DESCRIPTION for intensity indicators:
- Strong intensifiers (+0.1 to +0.2): "really", "extremely", "so", "very", "completely", "totally", "absolutely"
- Mild reducers (-0.1 to -0.2): "a bit", "kinda", "somewhat", "slightly", "little", "barely"
- Superlatives (+0.2 to +0.3): "most", "best", "worst", "ever"

STEP 4 - ANALYZE MIXED EMOTIONS:
If description contains contrasting feelings, balance appropriately:
- "grateful but exhausted" → Lower the positive score
- "sad but hopeful" → Raise the negative score slightly
- "frustrated but motivated" → Mid-range score

STEP 5 - CONTEXTUAL ADJUSTMENT:
Consider workplace-specific context:
- Physical fatigue affecting mood: "tired but happy" → Still positive, slightly reduced
- Stress despite achievement: "proud but stressed" → Positive range, lower end
- Coping mechanisms: "laughing through pain" → Acknowledge resilience in scoring

STEP 6 - EMOJI VALIDATION:
Use emoji as secondary validation, not primary driver:
- Matching emoji + label → Standard score
- Contrasting emoji + label → Label wins, emoji adds nuance
- Example: "😭(I'm happy) // tears of joy" → Still positive range

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:

"😊(I'm proud) // Completed major project ahead of schedule"
→ proud = mid-positive, major achievement = +0.2 → SCORE: ${Number((midPositive + 0.2).toFixed(1))}

"😩(I'm stressed) // Deadlines piling up and team's behind"
→ stressed = mid-negative, piling up = intensity +0.1 → SCORE: ${Number((midNegative - 0.1).toFixed(1))}

"😌(I'm calm) // Just a regular day, nothing special"
→ calm = high neutral, regular = standard → SCORE: ${Number((midNeutral + 0.2).toFixed(1))}

"😭(I'm happy) // SO EXCITED we hit our quarterly target!"
→ happy = positive, SO EXCITED = strong +0.3 → SCORE: ${Number((midPositive + 0.3).toFixed(1))} or ${positiveMax}

"😰(I'm overwhelmed) // Can't take this workload anymore"
→ overwhelmed = low negative, can't take = severity → SCORE: ${Number((negativeMin + 0.1).toFixed(1))}

"😞(I'm disappointed) // Just a bit let down by the results"
→ disappointed = high negative, a bit = reducer -0.1 → SCORE: ${negativeMax}

"🙂(I'm okay) // Decent progress, grateful but exhausted"
→ okay = low positive, mixed emotion = balance → SCORE: ${Number((positiveMin + 0.1).toFixed(1))}

"😭(I'm hopeless) // I can't see a way forward"
→ hopeless = high critical, can't see way = severity → SCORE: ${criticalMax}

8. **CRITICAL**: Use ==highlight syntax== to emphasize the most important or urgent points in your recommendations. Wrap key phrases, critical actions, or urgent concerns with ==double equal signs== like this: ==Immediate crisis intervention required==

**Highlighting Guidelines:**
- Highlight urgent timeframes (e.g., ==within 24 hours==, ==immediately==)

- Avoid stigmatizing language
- Focus on support, not surveillance
- Respect confidentiality boundaries
