## Notes

### Architecture & Code Quality
- **Maintainable Code Structure**: The codebase follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. Components, hooks, utilities, and types are organized in dedicated folders, making it easy to locate and modify code.
- **Component Reusability**: Shared components are designed to be generic and composable, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency across the application.
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types throughout the application catch errors at compile time and provide excellent IntelliSense in development.
- **Scalability**: The folder structure and patterns are designed to scale gracefully as the application grows, with clear conventions for adding new features.

### Performance & Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Routes are lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle size and improve time-to-interactive
- **Intelligent Caching**: TanStack Query provides automatic background refetching, stale-while-revalidate patterns, and cache invalidation
- **Optimistic Updates**: Form submissions provide instant feedback while processing in the background
- **Debounced Search**: Search inputs are debounced to reduce unnecessary API calls while maintaining responsive UX

### Developer Experience
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Vite's HMR preserves application state during development for rapid iteration
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Automated code formatting and linting ensure consistent code style across the team
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode enabled catches bugs before runtime
- **Reusable Patterns**: Custom hooks encapsulate complex logic, making features easy to implement and test

### Design System
- **Consistent UI**: shadcn/ui components ensure a cohesive design language throughout the application
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind's responsive utilities for seamless multi-device experience
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant components with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Dark Mode Ready**: UI components support theme switching for user preference

### Data Management
- **Centralized API Layer**: All API calls are organized in dedicated files with typed responses
- **Query Key Management**: Centralized query keys prevent cache inconsistencies and enable efficient invalidation
- **Global State**: Zustand provides simple, performant state management without Redux complexity
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas ensure data integrity before submission and provide clear error messages
